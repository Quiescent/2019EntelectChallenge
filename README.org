* 2019 Entelect Challenge
This is my submission to the 2019 Entelect Challenge.

* Getting Started
Haskell is a purely functional programming language.  You can find out
more about Haskell [here](https://www.haskell.org/).

** Environment Requirements
Install the [[https://www.haskell.org/platform/][Haskell Platform]] and ensure that the =stack= executable is
on the path.

** Building
Simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack install --local-bin-path bin
#+END_SRC

to build the binary and put it into a folder in the root of the
project called `bin`.

** Running
Haskell creates native binaries so you can simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./bin/haskell-bot-exe
#+END_SRC

from the command line to invoke the bot program.

         Worms are now represented as ALists of facts where the association is
         between the worm id and it's fact (health or position right now).  The
         representation allows for looking up a worms fact by id or finding the
         worm for which a fact is true.
       - Note taken on [2019-06-16 Sun 12:21] \\
         The new representation is one which associates facts with ids.  The
         games always happen between two teams of three worms so I can get away
         with an alist in which I removed the first element which satisfies the
         given id.  All alists will be of the form (Id, a) where a is one of
         position or health.  The Id will be a bit packed number, with the
         first two bits corresponding to my players three worms and the second
         two bits to the opponents three worms.

      Was not a problem.

      The original note from the source code:

       try to make a move into the space which I just cleared /facepalm
      ctually, that's not the problem because:
      a) I have a test which would fail if it were;
      b) Moving is the first thing which happens;
      c) This would only be a problem if both worms dig out the same
         dirt square at the same time.  This migh
         t result in one worm getting points and not the other.
      I'm going to create a failing test to that effect.

      The problem is that I move... and then I dig.  So if a player moves
      next to dirt such that if they kept moving then they would dig the
      dirt out, then they get a dig after a move(!)

      I decided to instead remove health from the points calculation
      altogether.  This is done by removing it when I read the state too.
      It works well and since it's not necessary while processing the tree
      and related state it is also faster and more correct.

    - Note taken on [2019-06-30 Sun 13:38] \\
      This works as a test case:

      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        it "should reward both players and remove dirt when both worms dig the same dirt block" $
          makeMove True (fromMoves digSouthWest digSouth) aStateWithBothWormsNearTheSameDirtBlock `shouldBe`
          (awardPointsToThatPlayerForDigging $
           awardPointsToThisPlayerForDigging $
      #+END_SRC
    - Note taken on [2019-06-30 Sun 13:36] \\
      The solution to this problem is probably to have one function which
      harms worms so that it can encapsulate the idea of a worm dying.

** TODO Implement "Minigames" strategy
The Minigame strategy aims to make the game less complicated so that
the tree search isn't overcome with noise.  I'll only consider a small
part of the map around the current worm.

If there are no worms in that radius then it's this worms job to see
what the best way to accrue points is.

If there are worms in the radius then it checks whether they're
enemies.  If those worms are enemies then it tries to come off with
the most health by some cut off point and ends the mini-game when a
worm dies.

When I implement lava then this strategy will have to change a bit.
I'll need to start using a different strategy at round 100 which is
more global.  I'm not sure what that strategy is yet.

Part of it is to only use snowballs, bananas and missiles when enemies
are in the minigame.

     Each player is given a different current worm id because they're given
     different states.  I need to represent the current worm for each
     player rather than as a global thing.

The engine provides one worm id, but the collections might be of
imbalanced sizes despite the fact that two worms must go at the same
time.
** TODO What the heck is the powerup attribute in the game config
* Potentially Useful, Discarded, Code
In this section I document the code which I wrote and then didn't end
up needing for some or other reason.  Such as having written the code
and then realising that I was doing the wrong thing.

** Worms Predicate
I wrote this worms predicate code for verification on end states, but
then I realised that the kind of stuff that I needed to verify could
be done simply by comparing the previous state to the next state.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  noWormShouldBeHarmed :: Int -> State -> Bool
  noWormShouldBeHarmed originalHealth state =
    allTheseWorms (notHarmed originalHealth) state &&
    allThoseWorms (notHarmed originalHealth) state

  notHarmed :: Int -> Worm -> Bool
  notHarmed originalHealth (Worm _ health' _) =
    health' == originalHealth

  allTheseWorms :: (Worm -> Bool) -> State -> Bool
  allTheseWorms f =
    allWorms f . playersWorms . myPlayer

  allThoseWorms :: (Worm -> Bool) -> State -> Bool
  allThoseWorms f =
    allWorms f . playersWorms . opponent

  allWorms :: (Worm -> Bool) -> Worms -> Bool
  allWorms f = M.foldl' ( \ acc worm -> acc && f worm) True

** Checking whether an Id is of a given value
It might be useful to verify the contents of an id to a valid given
id.
