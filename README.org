* 2019 Entelect Challenge
This is my submission to the 2019 Entelect Challenge.

* Getting Started
Haskell is a purely functional programming language.  You can find out
more about Haskell [here](https://www.haskell.org/).

** Environment Requirements
Install the [[https://www.haskell.org/platform/][Haskell Platform]] and ensure that the =stack= executable is
on the path.

** Building
Simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack install --local-bin-path bin
#+END_SRC

to build the binary and put it into a folder in the root of the
project called `bin`.

** Running
Haskell creates native binaries so you can simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./bin/haskell-bot-exe
#+END_SRC

from the command line to invoke the bot program.

     function into the =RIO Monad= because it's a transformer from =IO=
     already.
